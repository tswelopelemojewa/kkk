                                    disruptions. Develop mitigation strategies for each risk to minimize the

                                    This can help to reduce the risk of delays due to stockouts or production

                                    potential problems early on. This can be done by using a tracking system or by

                                    material delays. This could include having alternative suppliers lined up, or
